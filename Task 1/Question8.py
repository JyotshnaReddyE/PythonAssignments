#8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
a=3
a=4
print(a)

#Yes the value will be changed and prints the one which you have entered last.
#when the value is assigned to a variable it stores that value and
#when you reassign it, old value moves out and it stores the new value.
